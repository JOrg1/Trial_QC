Dear {!Case.Contact}:

 

Thank you for your support of WGBH.  The statement below indicates the donations
you made to WGBH for tax year 2011.  It
is provided to help with your record keeping and tax preparation in accordance
with IRS guidelines.

 

The total value of your donations is noted on the
statement below.  From that amount we
have subtracted the fair market value of any thank-you gifts received, as that
amount is not tax-deductible.  The total
tax-deductible portion of your contribution to WGBH is indicated at the bottom
of the statement.

 

This letter also provides me the opportunity to
recognize your commitment to WGBH and public broadcasting.  Thank you again for your generosity; it is
deeply appreciated.

 

Sincerely,

 

Daren Winckle

Director of Membership
