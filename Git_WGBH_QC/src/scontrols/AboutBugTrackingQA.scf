						<p><FONT size="2">Bug Tracking and Quality Assurance for AppExchange gives software makers a consolidated view of the bugs reported on their products, the fixes made, and who on the team is taking care of them. It takes much of the mystery out of questions like, “Which products have the most problems?” and “What features do our customers consistently ask us to add?” </font></p>
						<p><FONT size="2">Bugs and feature requests can be monitored to identify the products that are generating the most problems — and consuming the most resources. With the consolidated data provided by Bug Tracking and Quality Assurance you can spot quality trends, keep track of the status of individual bugs, and see who is assigned to review the severity of bugs. </font></p>
						<p><FONT size="2">You can also use this application to zero in on possible recurring product flaws to make sure they are corrected as efficiently as possible and ensure that underlying problems are addressed for future versions. By tracking feature requests, the application gives you the data to make more informed decisions about how your developers prioritize their time.</font></p>

						<h2 class="exchangeTitle">The AppExchange</h2>
						<p><FONT size="2">The AppExchange is the world’s first on-demand application-sharing 
								service. The dozens of pre-built applications and components it offers have 
								been created by salesforce.com customers, developers, and partners. With these 
								apps, users can do everything from managing expenses to tracking purchasing to 
								monitoring recruiting. Companies can browse, test drive, and install these apps 
								into their salesforce.com accounts with a single click. </FONT>
						</p>
						<p><FONT size="2">Using the AppExchange, organizations can easily add new apps to their 
								current salesforce.com deployments, run them alongside their existing on-demand 
								applications, and easily customize them to meet their unique needs. The breadth 
								of applications on the AppExchange — including CRM and many other types of 
								business apps — is limited only by the imagination of its publishers and the 
								on-demand community itself. </FONT>
